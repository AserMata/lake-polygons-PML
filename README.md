# lake-polygons-PML

This repository contains well-known-text (WKT) representations of the maximum water extent of a large number of water bodies. They have been created in the following steps:

1: raster data source: ESACCI-LC-L4-WB-Map-150m0P13Y-2000-v4.0, see http://www.esa-landcover-cci.org/

2: conversion of geotiff to shapefiles in 10x10 degree tiles using GDAL polygonize

3: manual matching of lake locations to polygons, editing (combining, splicing) polygons as necessary.
